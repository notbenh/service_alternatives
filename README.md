service_alternatives
====================

alternatives to existing services that you find your self using

This started out as a pirate pad (http://piratepad.net/NTi3s7kHmv)
between @vmbrasseur and my self. It was suggested (by someone far
brighter then myself) that this would make a better git repo so we can
better point to it and collect an even wider audience. Thus here it
lives! Feel free to file issues, supply support requests or even move
this all over to the wiki. For now all is fair game!

Apparently 2013 is the year of shitting on your customers, and I've had
enough. If I was to make a serious attempt to rewrite every service that does
not already have an open alternative what would that world look like:

email
-----

Currently I am using Gmail, though shifting to a provided email system should
be easy. IMAP is an open standard, it's just a matter of having a server that
plays MX. Or copping out and paying for something like pobox.

Requirements:

  * IMAP  

Suggested options:

  * pobox.com
  * Fastmail
  * Self-hosted  

chat
----

Fuck hangouts as a reliable way to continue with XMPP, though again it's an
open sttndard so just finding a way to continue in this vein would ~should~ be
simple. It also might be time to just lean in and go email/IRC only.

Requirements

  * XMPP?  

Suggested options:

  * DuckDuckGo XMPP
  * Self-hosted  

calendar
--------

There are currently no good web-based alternatives for Google Calendar.

Requirements:

  * Sync with iCal-enabled systems
  * Repeatable events
  * Invite others to an event
  * Sharable calendars
  * Multiple calendars
  * Event notifications
  * Accessible on web  

Suggested options:

  * Uh...I got nuthin'
  * Self-hosted?  

twitter
-------

Currently it's free enough that I have no real issues with continue with it
but it might be time to get back on identi.ca or some self hosted solution.

Requirements

  * ?

Suggested options:

  * Indenti.ca
  * App.net  

google reader
-------------

Requirements:

  * syndicate RSS feeds
  * dedupe feeds
  * keyboard navigation of feeds
  * un-minimize snipped contents from a feed
  * ability to track what has been seen and has yet to be seen
  * categorization/filing
  * tagging/saving of articles  

Nice to haves:

  * sharing is caring  

Suggested options:

  * NewsBlur ([http://newsblur.com/)](http://newsblur.com/))
    * Minus: keyboard shortcuts are inconsistant
    * Minus: updates are inconsistant
    * Minus: fails to process all content correctly
    * Minus: UI's a mess
    * Minus: sharing is extra clunky (ie only for newsblur?)
    * Positive: it's up and running
    * Positive: it's still free
    * Positive: others are using it
  * The Old Reader ([http://theoldreader.com/)](http://theoldreader.com/))
    * Minus: idea of 'read' seems shakey
    * Minus: share seems to be TOR only?
    * Positive: it's up and running
    * Postivie: it's still free
  * Self-hosted
    * Tiny Tiny RSS
      * Minus: SLOW
      * Minus: Chief maintainer is a jerk to the community  

flickr
------

Requirements:

  * be easy to upload to
    * Android/iOS app(s) [would a moble-safe web thing be good enough? No, probably not. Not easy enough. For instance: I didn't use the Flickr app until they made it easy.]
      * easy to take pictures
      * easy to upload content
  * create thumbnail versions of any uploaded content with the possiblity of other sizes
  * tag/group any uploaded content
  * content accessable via permalink
  * auto rotate images based on exif data
  * search based on metadata/tags/exif data
  * Access control to view images
  * Image licensing options (in metadata?)  

nice to haves:

  * ?

Suggested options:

  * Um...right. =)
  * Self-hosted  


personal cloud
-------------

   * Owncloud

hosting
-------

Here's the big one, currently I am on dreamhost. Nice service for something
simple but I'm currently at the $7-ish a month and they don't allow for
anything exciting... well guess what, everything that I want to do is just
exciting enough get in the way of the DH TOS... so where to put everything?

Requirements:

  * Command-line access
  * *NIX  

Suggested options:

  * Self-hosted
  * dotcloud (allows for node.js hosting that opens up SFW, etherpad, etc)
  * heroku
  * linode 
  * OpenShift (Red Hat)
  * Digital Ocean
   


### wiki testing

Attempt to see if the Readme parser speaks enough wiki to make links: 

* [[News]]
 * [[Google Reader]]
